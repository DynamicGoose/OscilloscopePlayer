# W4ve: Oscilloscope Video Player

W4ve aims to be an improved version of the Oscilloscope Player by YJBeetle.

## How it works

To get the outlines of the objects in the video it is run through edge detection. Now that we have the edges we can take that data and run a path calculation, which then gets encoded to an audio signal and is output via the sound card. The signal needs to be connected to the left and right channels of an oscilloscope in XY-mode respectively. 

## Improvements

### implemented

- english translation

### in developement

- better documentation
- binaries for download

### planned

- optimized code
- more userfriendly UI

## !!IMPORTANT!!

This project is in the early stages of developement! It is usable but will most likely take a bit of fiddeling around to get it working. A detailed Documentation is in the works.
